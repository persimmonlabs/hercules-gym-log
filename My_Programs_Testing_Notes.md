My Programs testing notes



**Page Load \& Display:**



Change the empty state messages to reflect current features and diction. Give options to choose from for the my workouts empty sate and the My Plans empty state.





**Basic Functionality**: good





**Workout Actions:** 



Sometimes selecting edit workout opens the create-workout page with prefilled data, except the pre-filled data is the pre-filled data from the last time the page was opened for a different workout. this only shows for a split second, but it shouldn't ever show old data. as soon as the page loads, the data that's loaded in should automatically be the data for the selected workout. not the stale left over data from a different workout showing up for a split second.





**Edge Cases:**



Workouts with very long names get properly truncated and formatted, however, i need to add some sort of character limit, just to prevent abuse so apply some reasonable character limit that won't get reached unless the user tries doing something excessive.     



Set a limit for 10 workouts in My Workouts





**Data Integrity:** good
